        <li>Chelsea Yuan, Computer Science and Communication Design, Junior</li>
        <li>I like both programming and design well enough. I like using code to implement my designs.</li>
        <li>I have experience with HTML/CSS/JS. I took CSE330 (Rapid Prototype) and have worked in some front-end engineering environments.</li>
        <li>I would love to pick up some tips and tricks that I probably still don't know surrounding HTML/CSS/JavaScript and maybe pick up some experience with a JS library. It would also be great to understand the designer to devloper translation because
            I've noticed it's a major point of contention in practical work.</li>
        <li>Screens are dynamic. Between mobile, web, and TV there are many different sizes and breakpoints, and a screen can be resized or reoriented at anytime depending on the technology. The design has to be able to adapt when the user changes their viewport.</li>
        <li>I quite enjoy <a href="https://www.betterment.com/">Betterment's</a> website design. </li>
