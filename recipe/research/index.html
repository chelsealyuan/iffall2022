    <!-- Over the next few weeks, you will be designing and building a web page that presents a recipe. We'll start that project by finding/choosing a recipe, and doing some design research. This week, you will upload an HTML document that presents the following:

The recipe content (at minimum, this includes title, description, ingredients, instructions, source attribution)
Sample imagery (this may or may not be actual images from your recipe source, it might instead be samples of photos/illustrations representing the type of images you intend to use)
Three links to recipe websites you have found, with a short (2-3 sentences) written review/critique for each, explaining what makes this site a good reference
Three links to non-recipe websites with stylistic or communication techniques that might inform your own design, also with a short written rationale

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castella">Castella</a>
          (カステラ, kasutera) is a kind of soft sponge cake that orginated in
          Japan, brought in the 16th century via Portuguese merchants, so it's
          name is derived from the Portuguese phrase "Pão de Castela" (“bread
          from Castille"). It is a specialty of Nagasaki, as at the time, it was
          the only port open to foreign trade. The cake is baked in square or
          rectangular molds and cut into individual slices. It gets it's volume
          from whipped eggs and uses a sugar syrup called
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizuame">mizuame</a>, a
          sweetener for

            ><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagashi"> wagashi</a></span
          >, and it can also be flavored with other things, such as matcha or
          honey. There is also a popular Taiwanese variant that was introduced
          from Japan during its rule over the island, and it has more of a
          souffle texture.

        <p><span class="bold">Prep Time: </span>25 minutes</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Cook Time: </span>50 minutes</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat oven to 356F (180C). Line cake pan with parchment paper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place eggs in a stand mixer (or bowl) and beat until the egg mixture
            has frothed up and thickened (4-10 minutes), slowly adding the sugar
            in in equal parts as it beats.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir milk (or water) and honey together in a separate bowl and heat
            to lukewarm until the honey is dissolved.
          </li>
          <li>Sift the bread flour and set aside.</li>
          <li>
            Add half of the milk and honey mixture to the eggs and mix by hand
            with a spatula until incorporated. Add half of the bread flour and
            repeat the mixing process. Repeat with the rest of the milk and
            honey mixture, then the rest of the bread flour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour the cake batter into the pan and tap to remove air bubbles.
            Bake for 10 minutes, then lower the temperature to 320F (160C) and
            bake for another 30-40 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take the cake out from the oven and drop the pan onto a solid, flat
            surface from a height of about 5" (12.5cm) to release the air from
            the cake to avoid collapsing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread plastic wrap on a flat surface, and flip the cake upside down
            and out of the pan onto the plastic to let cool. Wrap it with the
            plastic after it has completely cooled.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Recipe Websites</h2>
        <h4><a href="https://www.delish.com/">Delish</a></h4>
        <p>
          I enjoy Delish's site because it has their ingredients side by side
          with the directions to avoid scrolling repeatedly to check for
          measurements. I also like that they have a "Jump to Recipe" button, as
          it makes it easier for someone who may not be interested in
          reading/watching any of the extra information on the page. I also like
          that it clearly outlines the yield, prep, and total time at the
          beginning so that the user knows the parameters before getting
          started. It also provides a small poll that allows for interactivity.
        </p>

        <h4><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/">NYT Cooking</a></h4>
        <p>
          I like that NYT Cooking also has their ingredients set side by side
          with the cooking instructions, so I don't have to scroll up and down
          repeatedly to check for ingredient measurements as I progress through
          the recipe. It also has a function for ingredient substitution, which
          I think is important considering the amount of peopole that might need
          to accomodate food allergies/sensitivites or diet accomodations. I
          also like that is allows for reviews/5-star rating.
        </p>

        <h4><a href="https://www.jamieoliver.com/">Jamie Oliver</a></h4>
        <p>
          Jamie Oliver's site is nice as it provides very detailed nutrition
          information in addition to serving sizes, time, and difficulty
          information. It recommends other recipes at the bottom, and the
          directions are separated into smaller, managable steps rather than
          being shoved all into one step. The presentation of the recipes as a
          collection also makes good use of icons and information a user might
          want to know before clicking into a recipe.

          <a href="https://www.osulloc.com/kr/en/about/osulloc">Osulloc</a>
        </h4>
        <p>
          I love the presentation of information on this site, as their brand
          and style is immediately clear, and also reflects the packaging of
          their products. It gives a very clean feeling through its consistent
          palette and mtion design and offers a lot of "whitespace" to present
          imagery and video.
        </p>

        <h4><a href="https://westbound.mauer.co/">Westbound Mag</a></h4>
        <p>
          This sample magazine layout site is very dynamic, and it has good
          hierarchy when presenting it's articles. It's photography is really on
          brand and has a consistent style and theme throughout. It also
          provides sorting methods via tags and categories and recommends
          related content.
        </p>

        <h4><a href="https://adachirestaurant.com/">Adachi Resturant</a></h4>
        <p>
          Adachi Resturant has a really beautiful and dynamic layout with a lot
          of attractive motion design and photography. It site clearly embodies
          a theme of sophistication, which I think aligns with what the
          resturant wants to present themselves as for their sit-in dining
          experience. Their menus are organized and accessible from the site,
          and the content on them has clear hierarchy and lists the price of the
          item.
