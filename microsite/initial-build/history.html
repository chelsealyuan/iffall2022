          The Delmar Loop gets its name from a streetcar turnaround, or "loop",
          formerly located in the area. Delmar Boulevard was originally known as
          Morgan Street. According to Norbury L. Wayman in his circa 1980 series
          History of St. Louis Neighborhoods, the name Delmar was coined when
          two early landowners living on opposite sides of the road, one from
          Delaware and one from Maryland, combined the names of their home
          states. The town of Delmar, Delaware, on the border between the two
          states, derived its name in similar fashion. The Delmar Loop station,
          a stop on the MetroLink Red Line, is located at the eastern end of the
          area.

          The western demarcation of the Loop is generally considered to be the
          U. City Lions sculptures of a male lion and a female lion on pedestals
          flanking Delmar immediately west of the University City City Hall.
          West of the lions, Delmar becomes largely residential. The eastern
          boundary of the Loop traditionally was the St. Louis City border,
          punctuated by The Delmar Lounge at the corner of Delmar and Eastgate,
          but the area began expanding into the city proper around 2000.

        <p>
          This expansion has largely been due to the redevelopment efforts of
          Joe and Linda Edwards, owners of Blueberry Hill, The Pageant, and
          Pin-Up Bowl, and the Tivoli Theater, the Moonrise Hotel, and Eclipse
          Restaurant. The St. Louis Regional Arts Commission completed its new
          headquarters on Delmar in 2003, creating performance and office spaces
          for theater groups. The Pageant, located across Delmar from the Arts
          Commission, has become one of St. Louis's main venues for mid-size
          popular musical performances, featuring rap, rock, and country
          artists, including St. Louisans Chuck Berry and Nelly.

          The Loop attracts an eclectic clientele and wide variety of street
          life, due in part to its proximity to Washington University and dating
          back to the late 1960s when Streetside Records and head shops
          dominated the retail landscape.

                The Delmar Loop, often referred to by St. Louis residents simply
                as The Loop, is an entertainment, cultural and restaurant
                district in University City, Missouri and the adjoining western
                edge of St. Louis near Washington University in St. Louis and
                Forest Park.
